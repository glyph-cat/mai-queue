# Risks & System Limitations

## Adoptation of System
The success of this system completely depends on whether players are willing to adopt and cooperate.

## Trust Between Players Is Still Required
It is possible for one single player to take multiple tickets by using multiple devices or using incognito browsing. As such, this still requires players to look out for each other.

## Not All Players Have Card
While the system encourages the use of friend code, not all players have Banapass or Aime card, and some who do might have forgotten their account password, making their friend code unretrievable.

## System Down
All digital systems carry some risk of not functioning at some point due to too much traffic or bugs or cyberattacks. This system is not an exception either.
